## **Part 2: Code Documentation**

The project for HelpEveryone is organized into a well-structured folder system to maintain clarity and modularity, making the codebase easier to manage and understand. Below is an explanation of the key folders and files within the project:
help_everyone: The root directory of the project, containing all the necessary files and folders for development.
node_modules: This folder contains all the npm packages and dependencies required for the project to run. It is automatically generated when the project dependencies are installed.
public: This folder holds public assets like the index.html file, which is the entry point for the React application. This folder also contains static resources that are publicly accessible.
src: The src folder contains all the source code for the application. It is the main working directory where all components, assets, and styles are organized.
Assets: This subfolder within src stores all the images and SVG files used throughout the application. Examples include:
BuyingFood.png
HelpingElderly.svg
HeroImage.svg
SpecialHelp.svg
TENTS.png

Components: This folder is divided into subfolders that group related components:
Layout: Contains layout components that structure the overall layout of the application.
Layout.jsx: A component that defines the general layout structure, possibly wrapping two the NavBar and the Footer as well as the Outlet react components.
Reusables: Contains reusable components that can be used across different parts of the application.
Footer: contains the footer component
Footer.jsx: The JSX file defining the structure and logic of the footer section.
Footer.module.css: The CSS module specifically for styling the Footer component.
NavBar: Contains the navigation bar component.
NavBar.jsx: The JSX file defining the structure and logic of the navigation bar.
NavBar.module.css: The CSS module specifically for styling the NavBar component.
Features: This folder holds the main feature components that make up the core sections of the landing page:
AboutUs, BuyingFood, HelpingElderly, HeroSection, OurServices, RequestConsultation, SpecialHelp: Each folder contains components related to specific sections of the landing page.
HeroSection.jsx: The JSX file for the hero section, which includes the main call-to-action and imagery.
HeroSection.module.css: The CSS module for styling the hero section.
Features.jsx: A file that manages the features on the landing page.
Route:
Route.jsx: This file manages the routing within the application, defining how different components are accessed through URLs.
App.css: A global stylesheet that applies styles across the entire application.
App.js: The main React component that serves as the entry point for the application's components.
index.css: Another global stylesheet that might be applied to the overall document structure.
index.js: The entry point for the React application, responsible for rendering the App component into the DOM.
.gitignore: A file that specifies which files and directories Git should ignore when committing code to a repository.
package.json: This file lists the project dependencies, scripts, and metadata. It is essential for managing the project's configuration.
package-lock.json: This file locks the versions of dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.
README.md: A markdown file that typically contains instructions and information about the project, such as how to set it up and run it.
Styling
Styling in the HelpEveryone project is managed through a combination of CSS modules and global styles:
CSS Modules:
CSS modules are used for component-specific styling, ensuring that styles are scoped locally to the component. For example:
NavBar.module.css: Contains the styles specifically for the NavBar component.
HeroSection.module.css: Contains the styles specific to the HeroSection component.
These styles are applied directly within the respective JSX components, allowing for modular and maintainable code.
Global Styles:
App.css and index.css: These files contain global styles that apply to the entire application. They include base styles, font settings, and any other styles that need to be consistent across all components.
These styles ensure that the application has a cohesive look and feel, while still allowing for specific customizations through CSS modules.
This approach to styling keeps the codebase clean and modular, allowing developers to manage styles both globally and at the component level efficiently.

Responsiveness
The HelpEveryone landing page is designed to be responsive, and  ensures a seamless user experience across various screen sizes and devices. These  techniques were used to achieve this:
Media Queries:
Media queries are implemented to adjust the layout of the page based on the user's screen size. For example, the navigation bar may collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens to save space.
Flexbox Layout:
The Flexbox layout model is used to create flexible and adaptive components. This ensures that elements like the hero section and service descriptions adjust dynamically, maintaining their alignment and spacing on different devices.
Responsive Images:
Images used throughout the site, such as those in the hero section and service descriptions, are optimized for different screen sizes. This ensures that the images load quickly and appear sharp, regardless of the device.
Testing on Various Devices:
The landing page has been tested on multiple devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, to ensure consistent functionality and appearance. This testing guarantees that the site remains user-friendly and visually appealing across different screen resolutions.
The use of these responsive design techniques ensures that all users, whether on a desktop computer or a mobile device, have a positive experience when visiting the HelpEveryone landing page.
